<h2>INTRODUCTION TO EIDOLON.</h2>


<p>Hazlitt says, one cannot "make an allegory go on all fours," it must
to a certain degree be obscure and shadowy, like the images which the
traveller in the desert sees mirrored on the heavens, wherein he can
trace but a dreamy resemblance to the reality beneath. It therefore
seems to me advisable to give a solution of the "Eidolon," the symbol,
which follows, that the purpose of the poem may at once be evident.</p>

<p>In "Eidolon" I have attempted to symbol the course of a Poet's mind
from a state wherein thought is disordered, barren and uncultivated,
to that which is ordered and swayed by the true Spirit of Poetry, and
holds its perfect creed.</p>

<p>I have therefore laid the scene on a desert island,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
whence, as from the isolation of his own mind, he
reflects upon the concerns of life. At first he is a
poet only by birthright '<i>Poeta nascitur</i>.' He has
the poet's inherent love for the Beautiful, his keen
susceptibility of all that is lovely in outward nature,
but these are only the blossoms which have
fallen upon him from the Tree of Life, the fruit is
yet untasted. He has looked at the evil of the
world alone, and seeing how much "the time is
out of joint" has become misanthropic, and turns
his back alike on the evil and the good.</p>

<p>Then comes Night, the stillness of the soul, with
starlight breaking through the gloom. He gazes
on other worlds, and pictures there the perfection
he sighs for, but cannot find in this. Thus by the
conception of a higher and nobler existence acquiring
some impetus towards its realization.</p>

<p>We then find him lying in the sunshine with the
beauties of Nature around him, whose silent teaching
works upon him till the true <span class="smcap">Spirit of Poetry</span>
speaks <i>within his soul</i>, and combats the misanthropy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
and weakness of the sensuous <span class="smcap">Man</span>, showing
him that Action is the end of Life, not mere indulgence
in abstract and visionary rhapsodies.</p>

<p>In the next scene he makes further advances,
for the spirit of Poetry shows him that the beauty
for which he has sought amongst the stars of heaven
lies really at his feet; that Earth, too, is a star
capable of equal brightness with those on which he
gazes. He is thus brought from the Ideal to the
Real.</p>

<p>The fifth scene emblems the influence of Love on
the soul. It is the nurse of Poetry, and Sorrow is
the pang which stimulates the divine germ into
active vitality. Had he been entirely happy, and
the course of his love run smooth, he would have
been content to enjoy life in ease and idleness.</p>

<p>Next we find him looking broadly on life, on its
utmost ills as well as its beauties, but not with the
eye of the misanthrope, but of the Physician who
searches out disease that he may find the remedy,
and though the soul still sighs for the serenity and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
placid delight of the ideal life, the world of Thought,
the glorious principle of Poetry prevails, and he
sacrifices self-ease, feeling that he has a nobler mission
than to dream through life, and that here he
must labour ere he can earn the right to rest.</p>

<p>Thus in the last scene the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> and the <span class="smcap">Man</span>
have become one&mdash;he is <i>truly</i> a Poet. His prayer
maintains the direct and divine inspiration of the
Poet-Priest.</p>

<p>The action in short is the conflict of two principles
within the breast, the False and the True,
ending in the extinction of error and the triumph
of truth.</p>

<h3>THE COURSE OF A SOUL.<br /><br /></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Scene.</span> <i>A desert Island. The sea-shore.</i><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Man.</span></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How lonely were I in this solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This atom of creation which yon wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White with the fury of a thousand years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might gulf into oblivion, if the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew circumscription. Far as eye can reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around me lies a wild and watery waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every billow sentinel to keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its prisoner fetter'd to his ocean cell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What were it but a plunge&mdash;an instant strife&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then liberty snatch'd from the clutch of Death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tyrant, who with mystic terror grinds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men into slaves&mdash;But he who thinks <i>is</i> free,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And fineless as the unresting winds of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now rushing with wild joy around the belt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whirling Saturn, then away through space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he and all his radiant brotherhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwindle to fire-flies round the brow of Night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought is the great creator under God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begotten of his breathing, that can raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shapes from the dust and give them Beauty's soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though my empire be a continent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Squared down from leagues to inches, what of that?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mind contains a world within its frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Fancy peoples o'er with radiant forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replete with life and spirit excellence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! there is glory in the thought that now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stand absolved from all the chilling forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And falsities of life, that like frail reeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierce the blind palms of those that lean on them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the springs of my own being draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All strength, and hope, and joyance, all that makes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lone meditations sweet, and schools the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For prophecy. In the o'erpeopled world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We seem like babes that cannot walk alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fasten on the skirts of other men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their creeds, conclusions, and vain phantasies,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Too languid, or too weak to poize ourselves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here the crutch is shattered at a blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dependence made a thing for winds to blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And paraphrase in bitter mockery.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From this retreat, as from a cloister calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dream upon the busy haunts of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As things that touch me not. An empire riven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monarchy o'erthrown, here seem to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Importless as a foam-bell's death. The world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all its revolutions are now less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within my chronicles, than is the ken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a star's orbit on the fines of space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But like a mariner saved from the wreck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this calm spot I stand, unscathed, secure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the rough throbbings of the sea of strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And woe, and clamour, wherewith this world's life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ebbs and declines unto the printless shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of death. O! blessed change, if there were one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To love me in this solitude, and make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life beautiful. My soul is wearied out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With earth's fierce warfare, and its selfish ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slights and coldness of the hollow crowds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That are its arbiters; the changeful face,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The upstart arrogance of base-born fools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who crown them with their golden dross, and deem<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That</i> the all-potent badge of sovereignty.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O thou, my heart! hast thou not framed for life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A golden palace in all solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whither the strains of quiet melodies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Float on the breath of memory, like songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the dim bosom of the evening woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peopling its chambers with sweet poesy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou not called the sunshine from the morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To circle thee with a pure spirit life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the softness of its tender arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasp thee in the embrace of heav'nly love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou not heard the music of the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the calm stillness of the summer night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And read their jewell'd pages o'er and o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the bright inspirations of a bard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till glowing strophes rung within thy soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of glad Orion and clear Pleiades?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou not seen the silv'ry moonshine thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the dusky mantle of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like radiant glances through a maiden's veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till shaken thence they fell in a pure shower<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O'er flood and field and bosky wilderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wreathing earth with the glory of a saint?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O! thus to dwell far from the stir of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from its pleasures and its miseries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the panting cry of man's desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That waileth upward in hoarse discontent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here to list but to that liquid voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That riseth in the spirit, and whose flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is like a rivulet from Paradise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the wanderings of divine thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the soul, like the low ebb and flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waters in the blue-deep ocean caves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forming itself a speech and melody<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeter than words unto the aching sense&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stand alone with Nature where man's step<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath never bowed a grass-blade 'neath its weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hath the sound of his rude utterance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broken the pauses of the wild-bird's song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus in its unpeopled solitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be the spirit of this universe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Centering thought and reason in one frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the majesty of quenchless soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising unto the stature of a man,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That</i> is to make life glorious and great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dissolving matter in the spiritual,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the green pine dissolveth into flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not on the breath of popular applause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is the spectre of all nothingness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not on the fawning of a servile crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who kiss the hem of fortune's purple robe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lick the dust before prosperity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting the cogging of the downward scale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn from slaves to bravos in the dark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not on the favours of the politic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in the smile of honour, Persian-like,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pamper the pampered from their banquet halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to his starving cry, when fortune frowns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mutter their falsehoods through the bolted gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the brightness of the inner soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The placitude of peace and holy thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joyous lightness of the spirit's wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeping with equal strokes the azure sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Present, Past, and wide Futurity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the high tidemarks on the sands of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where thought hath swept her purifying wave,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O, Earth is beautiful! In such a scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The everlasting curse that sin entailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strikes on the heart by contrast, as though heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled back its portals till the holy wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of God burst on Creation. All is still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the rapt nightingale, that sings to rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth's warring multitudes, and this bright rill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose voice is eloquent as poesy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very breeze is hush'd that stirr'd the leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pleasure, and the golden clouds float on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though an angel steered them o'er the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven. It is a blessed thing to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The melody of silence in the woods,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When outer life is hushed, and in the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The echo of its murmurous sweetness sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in the pauses of a song the harp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still vibrates. 'Tis a test by which the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies open unto Nature, for its frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impure or guilty, unto discord turns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those tones of peace and harmony. Perchance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These woods ne'er heard the voice of man till now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor know the motion of his jarring thoughts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel the weight of judgment o'er my head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, Adam-like, I bring the brand of guilt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this unfallen Paradise. In sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This scene is rich in Eden loveliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peace, and the rude din of jabbering crowds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheard as when Earth's generations yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay in the womb of Time. How soft the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathes with the scent of flow'rs, o'er which the dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs like a charm of sweetness! Ah, fair Earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis sad to die and leave thee e'en for heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the blue sky above is glorious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brings the spirit visions of bright scenes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet lovelier than this. There is a veil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dreamy beauty o'er it, from whose woof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystic star-eyes glimmer like a bride's.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In such an hour peace steals upon the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the soft twilight o'er the toiling world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no room for passion&mdash;strife would blush<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forth went he from the ebb and flow of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose busy vortex drowneth quiet thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold communion with wise Nature's soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In solitude. Amongst lone woods he roamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listing the murmurs of the swaying boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That quivered with the spirit of the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threading their arch&euml;d aisles with solemn heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hiving in his soul a myriad thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fell unseen upon him. Oft he stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On mountain fronts, and gazed long hours away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tracing the sweep of hill and dale, now veined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With glistening waters, and now dark with groves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still changing till sight lost identity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ideal and the real met.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the sun enter the golden gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Night, that closed upon his radiant path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left Earth wondering; and star by star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlid their shining orbs, and o'er heaven's plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wheel their bright cars to greet him in the East.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the morn break beautiful and pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like virgin from her slumbers, and robe earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dewy brightness, cresting the far hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With glorious halos of oncoming day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All loveliness of earth and sky he sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pondered with a heart attent to learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing that Beauty, like a parent stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is nourished by each trickling rill that flows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into it; and the soul that would be apt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To work its highest counsels out, must toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through long apprentice-ship to mastery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By units gath'ring fitness for the whole.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Amid their aimless wanderings, and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside that quiet worker, wondering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the majestic purpose on his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vapouring forth their self-important views,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That turned his course as little as the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swerveth the eagle in his lightning flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many applauded with patronic warmth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To shape and comeliness, his soul-deep eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed with the joy of high accomplishment,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A face that beaming on the heart of man<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And as the air by a bird's wing laven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a deep pool by a white hand waven,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wandering far through the lumin'd halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where light was bred in the ruby walls,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till all the arches mutter'd it after;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dazzle them so that the spirit dies.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Until they themselves sleep with the sleeper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Until there is only love awake,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Come in my bosom, then, come with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Down to the depths of the purple sea!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All my soul thrill'd and panted for bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As pilgrims thirst in the wilderness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cried, "O maiden, whose softest sighs<br /></span>

<h4>ON HER RE-APPEARANCE IN ENGLAND<br /><br />
MAY 4th. 1848.</h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Summer hath come, led on by sunny May<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue-eyed, round whose brow the first pure ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That trembles from the opening gates of dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still seems to circle, and the mossy lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they glide gently onward, ever breathes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beauty and a fragrance, which enwreathes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the being until every thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a strange mystery of joy is fraught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the hazel forms a leafy screen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of verdant matting, the cuckoo, unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chaunts forth her woodnotes through the stilly air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose silent motions far the accents bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou hast come, sweet Nightingale! once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er our entranc&euml;d spirits to outpour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy liquid warblings! 'Mid the flow'rets' scent<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And summer's gladness rises interblent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy loving welcome! Not the bird that sighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her thrilling love-tale through the moonlit skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Italy, as erst to Juliet's ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the pomegranate tree 'twas wafted near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seizes the soul with ravishment more sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than thy soft tones, stealing unto the seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of passion, waking echoes in the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love, and purity, and quiet rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring through the windings of the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till interpenetrated is the whole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With holy harmonies, and blissful sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joyance, and straightway is refted thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All baser feeling, and all earthly leaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the dear magic of that voice from heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Priestess of the Beautiful! that bringest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Missions of sweetness from above, and flingest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a rich flood of song&mdash;now faint, yet clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Helicon's own murmurs to the ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now swelling till around our being floats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thrilling cadences thy bell-like notes,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poetry of poetry, the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mysterious essences whose wavings steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life in the bliss of angels, and the real<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In the ethereal hues of the ideal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A welcome to thee! heartfelt as the lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hymn'd by the panting lark to the young day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joyous and loving as the sunny beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That greets the early primrose, when the dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of flowery revels through the noontide hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First steals upon it. Such a joy is ours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, as with falt'ring tones our spirits hail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy glad return, O sweetest Nightingale!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mountains! and huge hills! wrap your mighty forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close with mantle of eternal cloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gather around ye the fierce band of storms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the stainless snow-drift be your shroud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back from your rugged steeps, and caverns hoar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bellow in hoarse disdain the tempest's roar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laugh at the rolling thunder; let the flash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its fierce lightning lumine but your scorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down your deep-furrow'd slopes let torrents dash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the winds their hollow rage be borne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye mighty ones! Why should ye bow your pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doff your venerable crowns, or dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your wrinkled brows in smiles, or lay aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dread insignias of your mightiness!<br /></span>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Ofttimes I gaze upon thine eyes, fair child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till sense forgets all but the beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my entranced and raptured heart is full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blissful visions, pure, and bland, and mild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their o'erstealing, as the rosy sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That falls upon an infant, wafting it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In balmy dreams to heaven. Within the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thrilling sea of their blue loveliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sun-reflected gleams of heaven uplit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit bathes in sweet unconsciousness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of aught material, and oft doth drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauty there, whose freshness never dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, pleasure-lapt, it feels as it could sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the waves, and enter paradise.<br /></span>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">I traverse oft in thought the battle-plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my past life, 'mid many a shatter'd dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pleasure, and of hope, which youth in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Based on the shifting sands of Time's swift stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fond bulwarks 'gainst the strong assaults of pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'mid their ruins, like an exiled man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing on scenes where he can dwell no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stand and mourn their sweet enchantment o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where both life's pleasures and its cares began.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth crumbles 'neath our feet as we walk on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaves a gulf behind none can retrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its pleasures flash a moment and are gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if we treasure in our soul <i>love's</i> grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That</i> will refresh and gladden all our race.<br /></span>
